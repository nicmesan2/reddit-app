##Running the app
Start installing all dependencies using `npm install`

To run the app simply use `npm start`. This should compile a dev version of the code and start a dev server on port `3000`

To run the tests use `npm run test`

To run the linter use `npm run lint`

To run the Typescript check use `npm run ts:check`

To create a production build of the app use `npm run build`

##Technologies used

- React (UI library)
- Redux (state management)
- React Router (to manage SPA routing)
- Typescript (Javascript superset for adding types and writing more robust and maintainable code)
- React Testing Library (to write unit and integration test)
- Moment (time utility)
- Axios (AJAX requests utility)
- Styled components
- Prettier
- Eslint


##Roadmap

- Add more unit tests to the components on the `components` folder.
- Add more integration tests to the pages and pages components.
- Add Server Side Rendering for performance and SEO improvements.
